# ChatGPT-using-python

We need openai library to use ChatGPT with Python, run the following command in terminal:

pip install openai
or
pip install â€“upgrade openai

1) The code first imports the openai module and the readchar module.
2) The user must replace the mykey variable with their own OpenAI API key obtained through openai.com.
3) The code then creates a loop that will continue until the user chooses to quit.
4) Within the loop, the user is prompted to enter a sentence to correct.
5) The openai.Completion.create() method is your window into ChatGPT and is called with several parameters, including the text to correct, the name of the OpenAI model to use (text-davinci-003 in this case), and various settings for generating the corrected text.
6) The corrected text is returned in the response object, and the first suggestion is printed to the console using the print() function.
7) The user is then prompted to continue or quit, and their input is read using the readchar.readkey() function. If the user types y, it will prompt the user for the next sentence.
